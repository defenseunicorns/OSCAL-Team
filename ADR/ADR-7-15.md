# Architecture Decision Record 7-15-22

## Status
Proposed

## Background
In the First Dash Days Defense Unicorns' TEAM-OSCAL identified and validated the prpblem space as well as potential target user personas for a proof of value. We operated under the assumptions that cycles aspent on the accreditation problem space as it relates to OSCAL could improve OSCAL adoption, we identifed three main pain points:
- Generation
    - I.e., generation of initial OSCAL documentation for a specific tool (e.g., a document that clearly expresses the universe of controls (or class of controls) that could be inherited based on the configuraiton of a tool

- Tailoring
    - I.E., Tailoring of tool-specific upstream OSCAL documentation for a specific configuration

- Presentation
    - Presentation of the configuration-specific subset of controls satisfied 

We identified 3 main user personas for a solution/proof of concept in this domain:
    - Developers and package creators/maintainers 
    - Authorizing and security officials/risk assesors
    - Open source community (incl tool manufacturers)

## Context
The team evaluated current technology and implementations in the OSCAL ecosystem - then worked through answering a few core questions:
- What do we know?
- What work has been done?
- Where do we think we want to go?
- What do we still need to answer before we confirm scope and get started?

Performed a personas exercise for:
- Developer Persona
- Security Official Persona

The exercise resulted in a list of persona/user needs that validated our original hypothesized pain points. 

We created "how might we statements" out of each persona/user need: 
- Generation
    - How might we lower the barrier to entry for generating OSCAL documents at both the application developer layer and consumer layer?
- Tailoring
    - How might we take the controls that can be satisfied and accurately identify what controls are satisfied given the configuration?
- Visualization
    - How might we provide insight to know what controls are satisfied at any given time?

We created a list of potential solutions/approaches/features for each how might we statement.

We performed an impact/difficulty (2x2) mapping exercise on the list (see Miro board below).

## Analysis
Focusing on one user personal is optimal; we should focus on the user persona we have most direct access to/are most familiar with. In this case that persona is devs/package creators/ maintainers. Direct access/insight will allow us ti more easily validate/invalidate initial archiecture, etc.

By focusing on the developer persona we are narrowing the field of pain points to focus on out of the gate; we are producing a more attainable scope for a proof of concept. Specifically, by choosing the developer persona we are eliminating the "tailoring" work as part of a portential initial PoC. 

## Decision

Focusing on the developer persona and the barrier to entry (or optimization thereof) for producing initial, upstream OSCAL documents.
- Consuming existing catalogs and providing an interactive method for building and generating an OSCAL document for applicable controls.
- Implementing a schema that allows for specifying _when_ a control has been satisfied (IE configuration)
- If there are dynamics to satisfy control or just a one concept schema to satisfy control.

Stretch goals for taking the output of the above process and providing a mechanism for generating an OSCAL document based on the configurations for a specific environment/deployment. Also visualizing this artifact. 

## Consequences

- OSCAL is better understood and more easily translatable by tool application developers
- Applications and open source can collaborate on declaration and maintenance of controls more easily
- Versioned documents allow other OSCAL tooling to develop automations that consume the documents and provide reconciliation of that state (API driven etc)
