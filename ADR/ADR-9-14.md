# Architecture Decision Record - Dash Days 3 (12-13 September)

## Context
The previous Dash Days [7-15](./ADR-7-15.md) and [8-18](./ADR-7-15.md) had established personas and key objectives for the problem of version controlling a universe of possible controls that can be met by a tool against a given standards document, and what IS met with a specific configuration. This allows a breadth of controls to be met and inherited by an environment. 

There was no code produced coming out of Dash Days 2.

The team approached the third and final dash days with the intent to produce a demonstration that accomplished:
- Ingest a modified OSCAL component definition document which attests to some actionable rule-set for a control
- Validate each control against a live-cluster
- Produce a report on the pass or fail state of each control

### Scope
In order to produce a functional demonstration in the 2 days, scope was bound by the following:
- OSCAL document to be ingested was extended artibitrarily to allow tool functionality to be produced - backlog item created to convert to OSCAL compliant schema
- Target for demonstration was a single control which provides insight into the attested configuration - More validation for query accuracy required (not owned by the tool)
- Report Generated would be in an intermediary data format - awaiting further investigation for targeted output (OSCAL model?)

## Analysis
The team executed on producing the [Compliance Auditor](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/compliance-auditor) tool. It leverages the Kyverno engine for providing a mechanism of proving resources in a global context are compliant with the attested configuration.

### Stretch goals
Stretch goals were targeted - if time allowed:
- Ability to consume static manifests
    - Contributing to the ability to attest to controls prior to be packaged by a tool like Zarf?
- Ingestion by a GRC tool
    - Determined to be out of scope, 
## Conclusion
The team demonstrated the ability to add control attestations in an OSCAL-like document and use that to conduct compliance validation against live-clusters or
